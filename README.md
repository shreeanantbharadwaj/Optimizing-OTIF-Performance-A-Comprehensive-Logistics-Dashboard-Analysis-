# Logistics Dashboard for OTIF Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing OTIF (**On-Time In-Full**) performance in the logistics and supply chain industry. The dashboard provides key insights into delivery trends, performance metrics, and highlights key influencers across various parameters like salespersons, teams, cities, and service channels.

## Key Features
- **Delivery Status Analysis**: Comprehensive breakdown of deliveries into **Early**, **On-Time**, and **Late** categories.
- **Advanced KPIs**: Interactive KPIs for performance tracking over time.
- **Key Influencer Insights**: Identification of top-performing salespersons, teams, cities, and service channels.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Advanced visual breakdowns for actionable insights.
- **Performance Trends**: Monthly and quarterly trends to identify patterns and improve operations.

## Data Sources
The project uses four datasets:
1. **Orders**: Details about the placed orders.
2. **Salesperson**: Information on sales representatives.
3. **Customer**: Data about customers placing orders.
4. **City**: Information about the cities where deliveries occurred.

## Key Insights
- **Early Deliveries**: Representing **58.64%** of all deliveries, with the highest occurrences in May, July, and March.
- **On-Time Deliveries**: Accounting for **19.84%**, peaking in May, July, and February.
- **Late Deliveries**: Making up **21.53%**, most common in April, February, and March.
